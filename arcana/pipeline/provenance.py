class Record(object):

    A representation of the information required to describe the provenance of
    study derivatives. Records the provenance information relevant to a
    specific session, i.e. the general configuration of the pipeline and file
    checksums|field values of the pipeline inputs used to derive the outputs in
    a given session (or visit, subject, study summary). It also records the
    checksums|values of the outputs in order to detect if they have been
    altered outside of Arcana's management (e.g. manual QC/correction)
